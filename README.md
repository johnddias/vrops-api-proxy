# vropsrelay
REST-triggered API calls to vR Ops that return JSON payload

This works in conjunction with https://github.com/johnddias/vropslambdafunction

Provides a "DMZ" for the AWS lambda function to connect without opening access directly to your vR Ops API.

Be sure to set credentials and IP address in vropsrelay.py
